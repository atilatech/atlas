Non-fungible token isn\u2019t the most intuitive term since we don\u2019t commonly refer to the fungibility of objects in the physical world, but this is an important technical distinction when it comes to how an asset is represented on a blockchain. The goal for this post is not to detail every project within the NFT space, but to give a high level overview of what NFTs are, why they are interesting, and showcase some of their potential use cases."

This makes interacting with NFTs significantly more efficient than in traditional platforms. The same reason why cryptocurrency used in payments is more efficient than traditional payments, that it is borderless and significantly easier to transfer, applies to NFTs. For example, if you want to create tradable in-game items as a game developer, then you can instantly have them be tradable through protocols that allow for decentralized exchange of NFTs. You don\u2019t have to create your own marketplace or go through the onboarding process of a centralized platform in order to have the items be tradable."

The possibilities are endless when you have the ability to combine NFTs with DeFi building blocks. For example, the game Aavegotchi combines DeFi and NFT gaming where each Aavegotchi character represents a user\u2019s collateral that is deposited within the lending platform Aave, but you can also battle the characters, level them up, and equip wearables that change their traits."

One of the sellers of the card later admitted in court to trimming the card\u2019s edges to make it look better. You can ensure NFT supply doesn\u2019t change and there\u2019s no counterfeit or continued printing. For example, there are many counterfeit Black Lotus cards in the popular game Magic: The Gathering.

It was no longer fun and rewarding since players would just buy the best loot. In Diablo III, having the best loot was essentially the goal of the game so having an auction house severely affected gameplay whereas other games are not set up this way. It\u2019s important for game developers to find a balance on what should be freely traded for their game (e.g. skins rather than weapons, game time itself can be traded, etc)."

Then we\u2019ll see tokenization that bridges the traditional world but adds new possibilities such as advertising space represented as an NFT where you could sell advertising rights to a site and have that be freely tradable. This would be a form of digital real estate. These NFTs would allow people to bet that a website will get a lot of traction and that the advertising space will become more valuable.

Another point of friction with NFTs is that holders will need to self-custody them. However this complexity can be abstracted away with user friendly wallets that make it easy to onboard and support features such as a PIN, biometrics, and social account recovery.

Since NFTs use the same blockchain technology as some energy-hungry cryptocurrencies, they also end up using a lot of electricity. There are people working on mitigating this issue, but so far, most NFTs are still tied to cryptocurrencies that generate a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. There have been a few cases where artists have decided to not sell NFTs or to cancel future drops after hearing about the effects they could have on climate change. Thankfully, one of my colleagues has really dug into it, so you can read this piece to get a fuller picture."

Fungible assets are used everyday like the US dollar, Bitcoin, and even company reward points. In contrast, non-fungible assets mean that each unit is entirely unique from one to another. For example, real estate is non-fungible because each property is different from one to another due to varying features like layout, size, location, zoning, utilities, and valuation. \u200dNon-Fungible Tokens, or simply referred to as NFTs, expand upon the concept of non-fungibility by leveraging blockchain networks like Ethereum to represent unique physical and/or digital assets. NFT ownership is validated and tracked from inception using a public blockchain, allowing users to verify the provenance of any NFT all the way back to its origin. Thus, NFTs are best described as a \u201ccertificate of authenticity\u201d issued by the original creator on the blockchain, which provides cryptographic proof that the holder of an NFT is the rightful owner of the official asset it is tied to.\u200dNFTs provide a wide range of benefits, such as allowing artists to monetize their digital artwork, enabling games to create provably rare in-game items, fostering new ecosystems of digital collectibles, tokenizing real-world assets for increased liquidity, and much more."

Compared to traditional art marketplaces, which are often opaque, value-extracting, limited in discoverability, and require significant listing fees, NFTs can be listed on global, permissionless online marketplaces and can even provide creators revenue from all secondary sales.\u200dAn example of NFT art that made headlines is the famous digital artist Beeple. His piece \u201cEverydays: The First 5000 Days,\u201d a collage of 5,000 images that took 13 years to create, was tokenized as an NFT on Ethereum and sold for over $69M. Using the popular ERC721 token standard, Beeple was able to monetize his digital artwork and establish cryptographic proof that the specific NFT was the official copy.

With traditional online video games, centralized publishers have complete control over the distribution, ownership, and attributes of in-game items that often determine the value of certain characters and game outcomes. If the publisher shuts down, users lose access to all of the game items they potentially spent hours, days, weeks, or even longer acquiring.\u200dNFTs not only ensure users have complete control over their game items, but they enable entirely new gaming possibilities. This includes the distribution of randomized NFT rewards in blockchain-based games and the creation of an interoperable metaverse\u2014where the items from one game can be used and traded in another. NFTs have also furthered the growth of the play-to-earn model where users can monetize their time and effort from gaming by acquiring rare NFTs and selling them to others.\u200dOne popular blockchain-based video game leveraging NFTs is Axie Infinity, a Pokemon-inspired universe with unique fantasy creatures called \u201cAxies.\u201d Each in-game Axie is programmatically tied to an NFT that contains metadata regarding the creature\u2019s attributes, appearance, and ownership. Through verifiable randomness provided by Chainlink VRF, certain Axies such as a Quad Mystic can be made provably rare through a fair and verifiable distribution process, ultimately becoming more attractive to other players in the Axie universe."

CryptoPunks were some of the first NFTs ever created and were given away for free. They continue to attract users who want to own an original piece of NFT history.\u200dCollectible NFTs are increasingly being used as profile pictures on social media platforms like Twitter and Discord. Doing so provides a powerful signaling mechanism, where like-minded individuals can display their interest in an NFT collection and join a community of like-minded individuals.

Some examples of how randomness is applied to NFTs include assigning random attributes to NFT artwork, determining the in-game locations of loot boxes dispensing NFTs, or ensuring a fair distribution for a high-demand, limited edition NFT drop.\u200dHowever, if the source of randomness can be manipulated, then malicious actors can exploit the RNG mechanism to their advantage. For example, they could mint themselves NFTs with the rarest traits or direct lottery rewards to an address under their control. This has a significant implication on the value of the NFT if users cannot verify that its attributes or distribution are truly random. Since smart contracts cannot generate their own secure form of randomness, a proven oracle solution is required.\u200dChainlink VRF is a Verifiable Random Function that provides smart contracts and NFTs with a secure source of randomness backed by a cryptographic proof. The cryptographic proof serves as an audit trail proving the RNG operated in a tamper-proof manner. The cryptographic proof is then validated on-chain before delivering the random number to the consuming NFT contract, helping guarantee only truly random values are consumed. The strong security properties of Chainlink VRF help ensure neither the oracle, users, or developers can manipulate or predict the random number generated, resulting in NFTs that are assigned provably rare attributes and NFT collections distributed in a verifiably fair and unbiased manner."

By creating a system of verifiable digital ownership NFTs fundamentally changed the market for digital assets, creating the possibility for new types of transactions. Amidst a flood of new ventures, however, it can be hard to tell which are creating value and which are just riding the hype. The companies that have been most successful on this new frontier have a few things in common: They make meaningful use of the NFT technology itself, leverage a community of users, generate confidence that they can continue executing on the project to maintain ongoing community engagement, offer accessible \u201con-ramps\u201d for new users, and are able to weather crypto market swings."

Markets can\u2019t operate without clear property rights: Before someone can buy a good, it has to be clear who has the right to sell it, and once someone does buy, you need to be able to transfer ownership from the seller to the buyer. NFTs solve this problem by giving parties something they can agree represents ownership. In doing so, they make it possible to build markets around new types of transactions \u2014 buying and selling products that could never be sold before, or enabling transactions to happen in innovative ways that are more efficient and valuable."

As the network gets busier, transaction speeds suffer and gas prices increase as users attempt to outbid each other.

Earlier this month, TikTok partnered with Immutable X to drop their first NFT collection, TikTok Top Moments, featuring culturally significant TikToks from Lil Nas X and other prominent users.

Based on what validation messages are present in the ledger, a validator can decide if any node is considered up (valid) or down (invalid), and if the network has submitted a sufficient amount of votes for the ledger to be considered valid. Messages are not required to arrive at any given validator in a timely manner. The ledger eventually arrives to every validator, and because the messages are part of the ledger, PoH provides the cryptographic guarantee that the messages were created when they claim."

The second approach is that every state transition has a local timeout before it expires. On Tendermint, for example, a precommit state has a one second timeout. The next block producer can try to propose the next block, but all the nodes in the network will wait for at least 1 second from the start of the precommit state transition before considering the new proposal."

The shorter the block time, the higher the likelihood of two nodes producing a block at the same time, and 15 seconds is likely the lower bound of how fast a Nakamoto style chain can produce a block."

The Solana protocol has no dependencies on local computer clocks or local timeouts between state transitions beyond the Verifiable Delay Function. Instead, the VDF ensures that each block producer proves they have waited a sufficient amount of time, and the network moves forward. Unlike Tendermint, the next block producer has to locally generate a portion of the VDF until the scheduled slot."

The first, already alluded to above, is by removing rent-seeking intermediaries. The logic of blockchains is once you purchase an NFT it is yours to fully control, just like when you buy books or sneakers in the real world. There are and will continue to be NFT platforms and marketplaces, but they will be constrained in what they can charge because blockchain-based ownership shifts the power back to creators and users \u2014 you can shop around and force the marketplace to earn its fees. (Note that lowering the intermediary fees can have a multiplier effect on creator disposable income. For example, if you make $100K in revenue and have $80K in costs, cutting out a 50% take rate increases your revenue to $200K, multiplying your disposable income 6x, from $20K to $120K.)"

                "text": "The second way NFTs change creator economics is by enabling granular price tiering. In ad-based models, revenue is generated more or less uniformly regardless of the fan\u2019s enthusiasm level. As with Substack, NFTs allow the creator to \u201ccream skim\u201d the most passionate users by offering them special items which cost more. But NFTs go farther than non-crypto products in that they are easily sliced and diced into a descending series of pricing tiers. NBA Top Shot cards range from over $100K to a few dollars. Fan of Bitcoin? You can buy as much or little as you want, down to 8 decimal points, depending on your level of enthusiasm. Crypto\u2019s fine-grained granularity lets creators capture a much larger area under the demand curve."

Open any tech S-1 filing and you\u2019ll see massive user/customer acquisition costs, usually going to online ads or sales staff. Crypto, by contrast, has grown to over a trillion dollars in aggregate market capitalization with almost no marketing spend. Bitcoin and Ethereum don\u2019t have organizations behind them let alone marketing budgets, yet are used, owned, and loved by tens of millions of people."

Modern video games like Fortnite contain sophisticated economies that mix fungible tokens like V-Bucks with NFTs/virtual goods like skins.

Members contributed ETH and received DAO tokens in return that could be used for voting on which projects the funds should be allocated to. It raised $150 million in ETH and was hacked with $60 million stolen. One interesting part is that even though the DAO is now defunct, anyone is still able to see all of the transactions that occurred since it is on a public blockchain and this record will never go away. Unfortunately the DAO hack temporarily left a negative impression or skepticism of the term DAO for many people but DAOs are an extremely powerful form of organizing and it didn\u2019t take long to see a resurgence in DAO activity in the crypto space."

For example the Empty Set Dollar (ESD) DAO is paying a $180,000 salary to its community manager Lewi who said this was the highest salary role of his career.

Imagine automatically sending money from one person to another but only when a certain set of conditions are met. For example an individual wants to purchase a home from another person. Traditionally there are multiple third parties involved in the exchange including lawyers and escrow agents which makes the process unnecessarily slow and expensive. With Ethereum, a piece of code could automatically transfer the home ownership to the buyer and the funds to the seller after a deal is agreed upon without needing a third party to execute on their behalf."

Think of the numerous applications that act as a third party to connect you with others based on some set logic (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, eBay). Many of the centralized systems we use today could be built in a decentralized manner on Ethereum. With Ethereum you can make these transactions trustless which opens up an entire world of decentralized applications. Decentralization is important because it eliminates single points of failure or control. This makes internal collusion and external attacks impractical. Decentralized platforms cut out the middlemen which ultimately leads to lower costs for the user. There are a few decentralized applications I am particularly excited about."

If something is truly decentralized, it becomes very difficult to change, and often remains stuck in time. That is a problem for technology, because the rest of the ecosystem is moving very quickly, and if you don\u2019t keep up you will fail. There are entire parallel industries focused on defining and improving methodologies like Agile to try to figure out how to organize enormous groups of people so that they can move as quickly as possible because it is so critical. When the technology itself is more conducive to stasis than movement, that\u2019s a problem.

Which sounds\u2026 familiar. At this point, there are basically two companies. Almost all dApps use either Infura or Alchemy in order to interact with the blockchain.

Imagine if every time you interacted with a website in Chrome, your request first went to Google before being routed to the destination and back. That\u2019s the situation with ethereum today.

This might suggest that decentralization itself is not actually of immediate practical or pressing importance to the majority of people downstream, that the only amount of decentralization people want is the minimum amount required for something to exist, and that if not very consciously accounted for, these forces will push us further from rather than closer to the ideal outcome as the days become less early."

That puts an artificial floor on all bids, since otherwise you\u2019d lose money by accepting a bid for less than the gas fees. Payment fees by credit card, which typically feel extortionary, look cheap compared to that. OpenSea could even publish a simple transparency log if people wanted a public record of transactions, offers, bids, etc to verify their accounting."

That opens the door to Coinbase managing the tokens themselves through dark pools that Coinbase holds, which helpfully eliminates the transaction fees and makes it possible to avoid having to interact with smart contracts at all. Eventually, all the web3 parts are gone, and you have a website for buying and selling JPEGS with your debit card. The project can\u2019t start as a web2 platform because of the market dynamics, but the same market dynamics and the fundamental forces of centralization will likely drive it to end up there."

If it churns out, then this will be a blip. Personally, I think enough money has been made at this point that there are enough faucets to keep it going, and this won\u2019t just be a blip. If that\u2019s the case, it seems worth thinking about how to avoid web3 being web2x2 (web2 but with even less privacy) with some urgency."

It is, at the very least, something new on the nerd level \u2013 and that creates a space for creativity/exploration that is somewhat reminiscent of early internet days. Ironically, part of that creativity probably springs from the constraints that make web3 so clunky. I\u2019m hopeful that the creativity and exploration we\u2019re seeing will have positive outcomes, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s enough to prevent all the same dynamics of the internet from unfolding again."

I think changing our relationship to technology will probably require making software easier to create, but in my lifetime I\u2019ve seen the opposite come to pass.

Moving forward, anytime that piece of media is distributed on another platform, that platform can \"check its passport\" and see its entire history. This means that instances of an idea can point back to the original, immutable record registered on the blockchain. An image on the internet no longer needs to be a two-dimensional box.

A key tenet of new Ownership Economy platforms is the incentive alignment that comes from having skin in the game. With regard to supporting creators, I've called this \u201cPatronage+\u201d where the \u201cplus\u201d is the possibility of earning value alongside the creators you support. This is a strong, under-explored incentive to become a patron in the first place\u2014and I think it may drive more engaging and rewarding demand in markets for creative work."

Solving the puzzles lets users, or \u201cminers,\u201d add a new \u201cblock\u201d of verified transactions to a decentralized ledger called the blockchain. The miner then gets new tokens or transaction fees as a reward. The process is incredibly energy inefficient on purpose. The idea is that using up inordinate amounts of electricity \u2014 and probably paying a lot for it \u2014 makes it less profitable for someone to muck up the ledger.

If NFTs significantly push up the value of Ethereum, miners might try to cash in by upping how many machines they use. More machines generally mean more pollution.
